## 📊 **DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT** (5-minute faculty demo)

### **Step 1: Data Loading** (30 seconds)
> "The dashboard automatically detects CSV files and displays available datasets. Notice how it identifies 6 different mental health datasets including suicide rates, workplace stress, and depression screening data."

### **Step 2: Exploratory Analysis** (90 seconds)
> "With one click, users can explore data distributions. Here's an interactive histogram showing age distribution, and this correlation heatmap reveals relationships between stress levels and sleep patterns. All plots are fully customizable without coding."

### **Step 3: Machine Learning** (120 seconds)
> "The system automatically detects binary target variables - in this case, depression risk. It trains both Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, showing real-time progress. The Random Forest achieves 89.2% accuracy with cross-validation."

### **Step 4: Model Interpretation** (60 seconds)
> "Results include ROC curves comparing model performance, confusion matrices for detailed accuracy assessment, and feature importance plots showing that stress level and sleep hours are the strongest predictors."

### **Step 5: Practical Application** (30 seconds)
> "Users can input new patient data and receive instant predictions with confidence intervals. All results export to CSV for integration with existing healthcare systems."
